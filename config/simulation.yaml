# ApexVelocity Simulation Configuration
# Default physics parameters for the Universe system

gravity: 9.81                     # m/s^2 (Earth standard)
air_density: 1.225                # kg/m^3 (sea level at 15°C)
step_size_meters: 1.0             # sampling resolution along paths
enable_rollover_checks: true      # enable vehicle rollover safety calculations
global_friction_multiplier: 1.0   # multiplier for wet/ice scenarios (1.0 = dry conditions)

# Advanced parameters
# Absolute velocity ceiling used by the solver when curvature/speed limits
# would otherwise allow unreasonably high speeds. This keeps flat/straight
# segments in a realistic highway range for energy calculations.
max_velocity_cap: 33.33           # m/s (~120 km/h)
min_curvature_threshold: 1.0e-9   # 1/m - below this, treat as straight line
